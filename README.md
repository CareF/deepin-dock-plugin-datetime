deepin dock plugin datetime
============

This is mostly a fork of the [official version](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-dock/tree/master/plugins/datetime) except for adding date display. 


### install

```
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

This work is compiled under Arch Linux, with `dtkcore` providing some header files. There may be some modification needed for other distributions. See [this](https://github.com/CareF/deepin-dock-plugin-datetime/issues/1) for details.
